But wherefore do ⛔ you 🅰 mightier way 
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time? 
And fortify yourself in your decay 
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme? 
Now 🧍 you 🔛 the 🎩 of 🙋 hours, 
And many maiden 🏡 yet unset 
With virtuous wish would 🐻 your living 💐 
Much liker than your painted counterfeit: 
So should the lines of 🧬 that 🧬 repair, 
Which this, Time's 📝 or my pupil ✒ 
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair, 
🥫 make you live yourself in 🤩 of NA 
To give away yourself keeps yourself still, 
And you must live, drawn by your own 🍠 🤹
